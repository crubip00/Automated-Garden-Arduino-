1.Concept:
	Create an Arduino automated system for water the plants according specific levels of soil moisture and collect the data for further improvements

2.Parts:
	2.1 Arduino. 
	2.2 Sensors. (soil moisture, temperature, water level)
	2.3 Resistors.
	2.4 Water pump or water valve.
	2.4 Water reservoir.
	2.5 Cables and others parts.
  
3.Steps:
	3.1 Create the PID (Project Initiation Documentation) and present to the client.
		3.1.1 Make the client request changes after the presentation of the PID and before start the project development.
	3.2 Buy the parts.
	3.3 Design the system and develop the arduino code according the specifications.
	3.4 Test
	3.5 Install 
	3.6 Support
